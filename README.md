# About me :mage:

I love programming and I am constatly trying to expand my knowledge of tools, technologies and concepts :microscope:  
I am aiming to create deeply engaging and creative games that will successfully bring pure entertaiment for the players :video_game:

I am interested in topics such as world-building :world_map:, 3D modelling :globe_with_meridians:, video editing :clapper: and graphics design :framed_picture:

# Stuff I am working on right now :building_construction:

##### Improving details on kitchen's render in Blender :fried_egg:
I needed a background for my `Jar The Beans` game. Forest seemed little out of place, so I searched up some free kitchens online.

It turned out every of the available kitchens have over 400.000 triangles, reaching to an almost 1 milion. It was way too much.

This lead me to create my own one with a goal to make it optimized while looking good enough for a background usage.

It is almost completed, I used it already in Blender animation for university's project. I just want to add some last detail and finishing touches.


##### Close up `Jar The Beans` game :beans: :jar:
Started as a learning project it evolved with ideas. It is still a simple game, but with more variantions coming.

I want to develop it enough to be in an usable and working state. I want to make it modular, just to be able to add more content without major issues.

The final goal is 50 types of Jars, all with accesories, personalities, dialogues and proper hitboxes. 
For my now my goal is about 15 of them.


##### Develop a fully working website (WdAI) :spiral_note_pad:
I needed a tool to write and visualize the stories, characters, events of the worlds I try to come up with. The problem is, there isn't a tool for that.

So I decided that I can create one and just happen that at University we have a subject about Web development.

I am going to build up a website which will let you add notes, tag, group and visualize them in order to clearly show you in which areas you may lack the content.

An example: you have created two cities, one have assigned to it 50 stories and 20 characters, the other one has only 20 stories and 4 characters. By visualizing it in nested lists (or size-reactive dots) you'll see where in the story you may lack extra content letting you balance it evenly and not lost the track of it complexity.


##### Make a game in Unreal Engine 5 as Uni project: chess or checkers :chess_pawn:
One of the University subject is basically OOP - and we can make anything that includes it.

So to futher improve my skills I am going to follow a tutorial and create a game in UE5 - either about chess or checkers.

That's all to it.
