# About me :mage:

I love programming and I am constatly trying to expand my knowledge of tools, technologies and concepts :microscope:  
I am aiming to create deeply engaging and creative games that will successfully bring pure entertaiment for the players :video_game:

I am interested in topics such as world-building :world_map:, 3D modelling :globe_with_meridians:, video editing :clapper: and graphics design :framed_picture:

# Stuff I am working on right now :building_construction:

### 1. Improving details on kitchen's render in Blender :fried_egg:
I needed a background for my `Jar The Beans` game. Forest seemed a little out of place, so I looked up some free kitchens online. <br/>
It turned out each of the available kitchens had over 400.000 triangles, reaching up to almost 1 million. It was way too much. <br/>
This led me to create my own one with the goal to making it optimized while looking good enough for background use. <br/>
It is almost complete, I already used it in Blender animation for a university project. I just want to add some final details and finishing touches. <br/>

### 2. Close up `Jar The Beans` game :beans: :jar:
It started as a learning project and evolved with new ideas. It's still a simple game, but more variantions are coming. <br/>
I want to develop it enough to be in a usable state. I want it modular, so I can add more content without major issues. <br/>
The final goal is 50 types of Jars, all with accessories, personalities, dialogues and proper hitboxes. <br/>
For now, my goal is about 15 of them. <br/>

### 3. Develop a fully working website (WdAI) :spiral_notepad:
I need a tool to write and visualize the stories, characters, and events of the worlds I'm trying to piece together. The problem is, there isn't one. <br/>
So I decided that I can create one - and it just so happens that at we have a university course about Web development. <br/>
I'm building up a website for adding notes, tagging, grouping and visualizing them - in order to clearly see where content may be lacking. <br/>

For example: you've created two cities, one have 50 stories and 20 characters assigned to it, while the other one has only 20 stories and 4 characters. By visualizing this with nested lists (or size-reactive dots), you'll see where in the story you may lack extra content - helping you balance it better and avoid losing track of its complexity. <br/>

### 4. Make a game in Unreal Engine 5 as another Uni project: chess or checkers :chess_pawn:
One of the university courses is basically OOP - and we can submit anything that uses it. <br/>
So to further improve my skills I'm going to follow a tutorial and create a game in UE5 - either chess or checkers. <br/>
That's all there is to it. <br/>
