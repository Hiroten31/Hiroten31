# About me :mage:

I love programming and I am constatly trying to expand my knowledge of tools, technologies and concepts :microscope:  
I am aiming to create deeply engaging and creative games that will successfully bring pure entertaiment for the players :video_game:

I am interested in topics such as world-building :world_map:, 3D modelling :globe_with_meridians:, video editing :clapper: and graphics design :framed_picture:


# My stack :books:

In my free time I am developing skills in:
[![My Skills](https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=unreal,blender,cpp,vim,visualstudio,git,github,ps,unity,cs,mysql,html,css)](https://skillicons.dev)

At work I am using those technologies:

# Stuff I am working on right now :building_construction:

    <h3 style="display: inline-block;">:globe_with_meridians: Improving details on kitchen's render in Blender :fried_egg:</h3>
  </summary>
  I needed a background for my `Jar The Beans` game. Forest seemed a little out of place, so I looked up some free kitchens online. <br/>
  It turned out each of the available kitchens had over 400.000 triangles, reaching up to almost 1 million. It was way too much. <br/>
  This led me to create my own one with the goal to making it optimized while looking good enough for background use. <br/>
  It is almost complete, I already used it in Blender animation for a university project. I just want to add some final details and finishing touches. <br/>

  <summary>
    <h3 style="display: inline-block;">:slot_machine: Closing up `Jar The Beans` game :beans: :jar:</h3>
  </summary>
  It started as a learning project and evolved with new ideas. It's still a simple game, but more variantions are coming. <br/>
  I want to develop it enough to be in a usable state. I want it modular, so I can add more content without major issues. <br/>
  The final goal is 50 types of Jars, all with accessories, personalities, dialogues and proper hitboxes. <br/>
  For now, my goal is about 15 of them. <br/>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>
    <h3 style="display: inline-block;">:recycle: Re-developing a website using Frameworks (WdAI->ZTPAI) :spiral_notepad:</h3>
  </summary>
  I need a tool to write and visualize the stories, characters, and events of the worlds I'm trying to piece together. The problem is, there isn't one. <br/>
  So I decided that I can create one - and it just so happens that we have a university course about Web development. <br/>
  I'm building up a website for adding notes, tagging, grouping and visualizing them - in order to clearly see where content may be lacking. <br/>

  After the first part of the course and completing semi-working site, I am ready to wipe it and build it cleaner from scratch using Frameworks (as the second part of course require it)
